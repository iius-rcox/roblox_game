## 🏗️ Technical Architecture for Milestone 1

### New Systems to Build

#### 1. HubManager.lua (Enhanced)
```lua
-- Current: Basic hub structure
-- Target: Full plot management system
HubManager = {
    plots = {},           -- All 20 plot instances
    availablePlots = {},  -- Unclaimed plots
    playerPlots = {},     -- Player -> Plot mapping
    plotQueue = {},       -- Players waiting for plots
}
```

#### 2. PlotSelector.lua (New)
```lua
-- Plot selection and management
PlotSelector = {
    ShowPlotMenu(),       -- Display available plots
    SelectPlot(),         -- Player selects a plot
    ClaimPlot(),          -- Player claims ownership
    TransferPlot(),       -- Player switches plots
}
```

#### 3. NetworkManager.lua (Enhanced)
```lua
-- Current: Basic RemoteEvents
-- Target: Full multiplayer networking
NetworkManager = {
    PlayerJoined(),       -- Handle new players
    PlayerLeft(),         -- Handle leaving players
    UpdatePlayerData(),   -- Sync player progress
    AbilityTheft(),       -- Handle ability stealing
}
```

#### 4. TycoonSync.lua (New)
```lua
-- Synchronize tycoon data across clients
TycoonSync = {
    SyncTycoonState(),    -- Update tycoon status
    SyncPlayerProgress(), -- Update player data
    HandleInteractions(), -- Player-to-player actions
}
```

### Data Flow for Milestone 1

```
Player Joins → HubManager → Plot Selection → Tycoon Assignment
     ↓
Plot Claimed → NetworkManager → TycoonSync → All Clients Updated
     ↓
Player Enters → TycoonBase → Ability System → Multiplayer Ready
```
