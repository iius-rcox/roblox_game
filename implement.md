# Roblox Tycoon Game Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
A multiplayer tycoon game featuring 20 different tycoons based on popular anime and trending memes. Players can own multiple tycoons, steal abilities from others, and compete in a shared world.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Systems
- **Tycoon Manager**: Handles tycoon creation, ownership, and switching
- **Ability System**: Manages player abilities, upgrades, and theft mechanics
- **Multiplayer Sync**: Real-time synchronization of tycoon states
- **Data Persistence**: Player progress and tycoon ownership storage
- **Economy System**: Cash generation, upgrades, and progression

### Data Schema

#### Player Data
```lua
PlayerData = {
    UserId = number,
    Username = string,
    Cash = number,
    OwnedTycoons = {[string] = boolean},
    CurrentTycoon = string,
    Abilities = {[string] = number}, -- ability name -> level
    LastSave = DateTime
}
```

#### Tycoon Data
```lua
TycoonData = {
    Id = string,
    Name = string,
    Owner = number, -- UserId
    CashGenerated = number,
    Level = number,
    Upgrades = {[string] = number},
    LastActive = DateTime,
    IsActive = boolean
}
```

#### Ability Data
```lua
AbilityData = {
    Name = string,
    Description = string,
    BaseCost = number,
    MaxLevel = number,
    Effects = {[string] = any},
    Requirements = {[string] = any}
