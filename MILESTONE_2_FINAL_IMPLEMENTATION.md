## 🔧 **Step 2: Test Real Game Scenarios**

### **2.1 Basic Multi-Tycoon Functionality**
1. **Claim Multiple Plots**
   - Join the game with a test player
   - Claim plot 1 (should succeed)
   - Claim plot 2 (should succeed)
   - Claim plot 3 (should succeed)
   - Try to claim plot 4 (should fail - max reached)

2. **Plot Switching**
   - Switch from plot 1 to plot 2 (should succeed)
   - Try to switch again immediately (should fail - cooldown)
   - Wait 5 seconds and try again (should succeed)

3. **Cross-Tycoon Bonuses**
   - Check that owning 2 plots gives 10% cash bonus
   - Check that owning 3 plots gives 20% cash bonus
   - Verify ability cost reductions apply correctly

### **2.2 Data Preservation Testing**
1. **Switch Between Plots**
   - Build some structures on plot 1
   - Switch to plot 2
   - Build some structures on plot 2
   - Switch back to plot 1
   - Verify all structures are preserved

2. **Server Restart Test**
   - Build structures on multiple plots
   - Restart the server
   - Rejoin and verify all data is preserved
   - Check that plot ownership is maintained

### **2.3 Multiplayer Testing**
1. **Multiple Players**
   - Join with 2-3 test players
   - Each claim different plots
   - Test plot switching simultaneously
   - Verify no conflicts or data corruption

2. **Cross-Player Interaction**
   - Test ability theft between players
   - Verify cross-tycoon bonuses work correctly
   - Check that network sync is smooth

---

## 📊 **Step 3: Performance Validation**

### **3.1 Monitor System Performance**
1. **Check Output for Performance Warnings**
   - Look for any "Slow operation detected" messages
   - Monitor memory usage warnings
   - Verify data integrity check messages

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Plot switching should complete in <100ms
   - Data sync should be smooth with no lag
   - Memory usage should stay stable

### **3.2 Stress Testing**
1. **Multiple Simultaneous Operations**
   - Have multiple players switch plots simultaneously
   - Test rapid plot claiming
   - Verify system remains responsive

2. **Edge Case Testing**
   - Test with maximum number of plots (3 per player)
   - Test rapid plot switching during cooldown
   - Test with invalid inputs

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Issue: Tests Fail in Roblox Studio**
**Solution:**
- Check that all required services are available
- Verify script is in the correct location
- Check Output window for error messages
- Ensure game is running (not just in edit mode)

### **Issue: Plot Switching Not Working**
**Solution:**
- Check cooldown timers are working
- Verify plot ownership validation
- Check network events are firing
- Look for error messages in Output

### **Issue: Data Not Preserving**
**Solution:**
- Verify PreserveTycoonData function is called
- Check data structures are properly initialized
- Look for cleanup functions removing data too early
- Verify save system integration

### **Issue: Performance Warnings**
**Solution:**
- Check operation timing thresholds
- Monitor memory usage patterns
- Look for infinite loops or heavy operations
- Verify sync intervals are appropriate
